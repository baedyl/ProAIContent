## Quick Test Checklist

Before publishing, check:

- [ ] Does it use contractions? (don't, it's, you're)
- [ ] Are there questions? (at least 2-3)
- [ ] Does it address "you"? (reader directly)
- [ ] Are sentences varied? (short and long)
- [ ] Does it have personality? (opinions, emotions)
- [ ] Are there em-dashes or parentheticals?

**6/6 = Excellent humanization**  
**4-5/6 = Good, minor edits needed**  
**<4/6 = Regenerate with better settings**

## Common Mistakes

### ❌ Mistake 1: Too Much Perfection
**Problem**: Every paragraph is 3-4 sentences, perfectly structured  
**Fix**: Vary paragraph length. One sentence paragraphs are fine.

Like this.

### ❌ Mistake 2: No Personality
**Problem**: Reads like a textbook  
**Fix**: Add opinions, emotions, questions

### ❌ Mistake 3: Corporate Language
**Problem**: "Utilize", "facilitate", "leverage"  
**Fix**: "Use", "help", "take advantage of"

### ❌ Mistake 4: No Contractions
**Problem**: "Do not", "it is", "you are"  
**Fix**: "Don't", "it's", "you're"

## One-Sentence Summary
